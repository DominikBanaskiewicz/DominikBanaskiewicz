Hi ğŸ‘‹
My name is Dominik BanaÅ›kiewicz,
I'm Front End Developer
I started learning front-end development just a year ago, and ever since then, I've been hooked. The world of web development fascinates me, and I love the process of turning ideas into, functional websites. With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I'm constantly expanding my skill set and staying up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies.

ğŸŒ± Currently learning: Reafct, Redux, node.js and TypeScript
